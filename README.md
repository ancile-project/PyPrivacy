## PyPrivacy: Python Privacy framework

A wrapper for Machine Learning and Data Science libraries that allows 
to control and enforce data usage policies. Released data can be misused, 
but releasing data access is 
crucial for the functionality of many services.

## Main idea

Our framework binds datasets or even individual data points with
the corresponding policies which specify how the developer can use them. 

## Project plan

1. Integration with Jupyter notebook
2. Release beta version
3. Use cases implementation
4. (Potentially) Implement SMC and homomorphic encryption
